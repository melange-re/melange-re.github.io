Here&#39;s a breakdown of our main focus for shipping a new major release:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fast, Reliable Builds</strong>: We&#39;re fine-tuning Melange to ensure faster, more reliable project builds. This work is spread across a few fronts:</p><ul><li><p>implementing some missing compiler and build system optimizations, improving the associated dune rules, and honing the underlying artifact representation for optimal performance.</p></li><li><p>improving the Melange core to be faster to build, run and evolve.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>JavaScript Expressivity</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>we&#39;re aiming to make JavaScript idioms more intuitive in Melange. We&#39;re implementing more supported interoperability attributes, exploring new ways of writing bindings and surfacing their documentation and enriching the existing sections in the Melange docs.</p></li><li><p>we&#39;re planning on unifying the Melange core APIs around an abstraction over both <a href="https://melange.re/v2.0.0/communicate-with-javascript/#pipe-operators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pipe operators</a> <code>|&gt;</code> and <code>-&gt;</code>, allowing us to remove some modules where standard library duplication exists, ensuring a more consistent user experience, reducing confusion and evolvability of the code.</p></li><li><p>from supporting React 18 to introducing async component support, we&#39;re ensuring Melange stays up to date with the latest in React development. To make is easier to add these, we&#39;re planning to safely type JavaScript dynamic <code>import()</code>: this will make code more concise by removing the need for verbose workarounds but also ensures safety, reducing runtime errors</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Development &amp; Learning Experience</strong></p><ul><li><p>With an emphasis on user-friendliness, we&#39;re improving the Melange Playground with a few requested features: by the end of the quarter it will offer advanced code diagnostics, bundle the new Melange v2 <code>melange.dom</code> library, present errors and warnings in a more robust way and test a new way of learning how to communicate with JavaScript from Melange.</p></li><li><p>Until the end of 2023, we&#39;re going to design and start implementing a whole new Melange website consolidated around a distinct, consistent brand.</p></li><li><p>We&#39;re planning to publish Melange for React Devs, a guided introduction for developers with existing React.js knowledge, bridging the gap between React and Melange, showcasing how some common React.js constructs are expressed in OCaml / Reason and Melange.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="the-melange-legacy" tabindex="-1">The Melange Legacy <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-melange-legacy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Melange Legacy&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Having integrated with the OCaml Platform set of tools and ensured Melange package availability in the OPAM repository, our previous releases have set the stage for what&#39;s next: with Melange v3, we&#39;re striving for an even more robust, expressive toolchain with an improved set of learning resources and an unmatched in-browser learning experience on the Melange Playground.</p><p>The above is just a glimpse into what we&#39;re working on.
