# Module `Digest.BLAKE512`
`BLAKE512` is the BLAKE2b hash function producing 512-bit (64-byte) digests. It is cryptographically secure, and the digests are large enough to thwart brute-force attacks.
since 5.2
```
type t = string
```
The type of digests.
```
val hash_length : int
```
The length of digests, in bytes.
```
val compare : t -> t -> int
```
Compare two digests, with the same specification as [`Stdlib.compare`](./Stdlib.md#val-compare).
```
val equal : t -> t -> bool
```
Test two digests for equality.
```
val string : string -> t
```
Return the digest of the given string.
```
val bytes : bytes -> t
```
Return the digest of the given byte sequence.
```
val substring : string -> int -> int -> t
```
`substring s ofs len` returns the digest of the substring of `s` starting at index `ofs` and containing `len` characters.
```
val subbytes : bytes -> int -> int -> t
```
`subbytes s ofs len` returns the digest of the subsequence of `s` starting at index `ofs` and containing `len` bytes.
```
val channel : in_channel -> int -> t
```
Read characters from the channel and return their digest. See [`Digest.channel`](./Stdlib-Digest.md#val-channel) for the full specification.
```
val file : string -> t
```
Return the digest of the file whose name is given.
```
val output : out_channel -> t -> unit
```
Write a digest on the given output channel.
```
val input : in_channel -> t
```
Read a digest from the given input channel.
```
val to_hex : t -> string
```
Return the printable hexadecimal representation of the given digest.
raises [`Invalid_argument`](./Stdlib.md#exception-Invalid_argument) if the length of the argument is not hash\_length,
```
val of_hex : string -> t
```
Convert a hexadecimal representation back into the corresponding digest.
raises [`Invalid_argument`](./Stdlib.md#exception-Invalid_argument) if the length of the argument is not 2 \* hash\_length, or if the arguments contains non-hexadecimal characters.
