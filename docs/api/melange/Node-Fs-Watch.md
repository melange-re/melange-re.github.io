there is no need to accept listener, since we return a `watcher` back it can register event listener there. Currently we introduce a type `string_buffer`, for the `filename`, it will be `Buffer` when the encoding is `` `utf8 ``. This is dependent type which can be tracked by GADT in some way, but to make things simple, let's just introduce an or type
```
val on : 
  t ->
  f:
    [ `change of (string -> Node.string_buffer -> unit) Js.Fn.arity2
    | `error of unit Js.Fn.arity0 ] ->
  t
```
```
val close : t -> unit
```
