# Communicate with JavaScript

Melange interoperates very well with JavaScript, and provides a wide array of
features to create *bindings* to JavaScript code. A binding is a piece of code
that references a JavaScript object or value and makes it available for use in
Melange code. A very basic example of a binding is:

```ocaml
external confirm : string -> bool = "window.confirm"
```
```reasonml
external confirm: string => bool = "window.confirm";
```

The above code binds JavaScript's
[window.confirm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm)
function to a Melange function named `confirm`. Note how the binding includes
type annotations so that there's no ambiguity about the types of the arguments
and return value.
