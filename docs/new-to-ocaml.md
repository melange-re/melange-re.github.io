# New to OCaml?

As a backend for the OCaml compiler, Melange shares many similarities with the
OCaml language. Nevertheless, there are some notable differences between the
two. This documentation aims to clarify these distinctions. For features that
Melange inherits from OCaml, readers will be directed to the main OCaml
documentation.

If you are completely new to OCaml, it is recommended to familiarize yourself
with the language first. [Learn OCaml](https://ocaml.org/docs) is a good
starting point. but we recommend the following tutorials from the official OCaml
website:

- [A First Hour With OCaml](https://ocaml.org/docs/first-hour)
- [OCaml Exercises](https://ocaml.org/problems)
